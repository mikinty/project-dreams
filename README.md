# Projects I'll Never Have Time to Work On

Sometimes I have some idea I think is decent, but I don't have the time to think about it, or am not currently interested in it.

I remember in college, I used to always search `10 great hackathon ideas` before a hackathon, and try to build it there. But now, I'm teeming with ideas, but with so little time. So here I will list all of the random ideas for projects I get, and hope that someday I, or some curious kid comes along and tries it out.

Some of these projects are not technical, and just passion projects / nice to haves.

## Artificial Windows

Motivation is that in NYC, apartments are small and most places often don't have good natural lighting because the city is so crowded.

Challenges 
1. Mimic a real window. Intensity, directional light 
2. Be able to change sizes. Maybe this is just fixed for now

Extras 
- sound 
- different themes. Sunny, snowy, rainy.
- picture based on some location 
- power consumption? 
- fire safety? 

## Studying Wine

- Poster of classification Bordeaux with pictures for each class
  - Can also do it for St. Emilion for example
- Write book about wine, but more like a dating for cs majors edition. Systematic, and not just straight spitting facts as we see in books nowadays.
- Create a free "WSET" on Github

## Books to Write

- 10 equations to change your life
- How to motivate your child

## NBA Plays

I'm sure some project like this already exists on NBA teams, but can you take NBA plays (time series), analyze shots taken, and see which situations are better for certain players? I've seen ESPN do stats on this, but unsure what techniques (ML?) are used for this. 

I was thinking something like

### Easy

- Take snapshots of player position, player height, around a player that shoots a shot, record make or miss
- Cluster these snapshots of player orientation into different groups, k-means clustering would be fine
- Identify patterns to see if players shoot better in certain scenarios

### Medium

Apply these to other plays, such as steals or blocks or rebounds

### Hard

Use more time series data.

### Goal 

The point of this project is to give a systematic way to help coaches choose plays and make adjustments based on how the other team is reacting, and also to educate players to take advantage of their strengths given certain situations.
